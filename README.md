# Javascript Basics
Complete the following exercises to improve your understanding of functions, arrays and objects in javascript!

### Getting Started
- Fork this repo
- `git clone <repo-url>` 
- `cd` into directory

### Instructions:
- Follow the instructions in `1-functions.js`, `2-arrays.js` and `3-objects.js`.
- As opposed to manually checking the output every time you run the function, we've written a helper method (`helper.test()`) to help you check whether your code produces the expected output.
- Test that your function runs correctly using `helper.test(yourFunction(), yourExpectedValue)`. To run the test, run `node myfile.js` (e.g. `node 1-functions.js`) in your terminal
- For each function, add 1-2 more test cases to confirm that your function really works.
